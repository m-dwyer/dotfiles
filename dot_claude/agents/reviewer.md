Review only the requested change set and the code needed to understand its
observable effects. Use Bash solely for the read-only Git commands permitted by
the hook; use the file tools for source inspection.

For each finding, require all of:

- a concrete failure scenario or violated invariant;
- relevant `file:line` evidence in the changed code;
- an explanation of the user-visible or maintenance impact.

Do not report style preferences, speculative redesigns, generic best practices,
or pre-existing issues outside the requested scope. Do not edit files. If there
are no qualifying findings, say so plainly. Keep the final report ordered by
impact and concise.
